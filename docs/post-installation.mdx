# Post Installation: Auto Modrinth & GitHub Publishing

## Setting Up Automatic Publishing

After installing **Xtremely Optimized**, you can automate publishing updates to **Modrinth** and **GitHub Releases** using CI/CD workflows.

### 1. Modrinth Auto-Publishing (GitHub Actions)

1. Go to your repository **Settings** → **Secrets and Variables** → **Actions**.
2. Add a new **Secret** called `MODRINTH_TOKEN` with your API key from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com).
3. Use this GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/modrinth-publish.yml`):

```yaml
name: Publish to Modrinth

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Publish to Modrinth
        uses: Kir-Antipov/mc-publish@v3.3
        with:
          modrinth-id: your-modrinth-project-id
          modrinth-token: ${{ secrets.MODRINTH_TOKEN }}
          files: your-modpack.zip
```

### 2. GitHub Auto-Publishing (Releases)

1. Create a `.github/workflows/release.yml` file and add:

```yaml
name: Create GitHub Release

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*.*.*"

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Create GitHub Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: your-modpack.zip
```

### 3. Automating with Git Tags

- To trigger a new release, push a tag:
  ```bash
  git tag v1.0.0
  git push origin v1.0.0
  ```

Now, every new **release tag** will automatically publish to **Modrinth** and **GitHub Releases**.
